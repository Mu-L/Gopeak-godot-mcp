**GoPeak is an MCP server for Godot 4 that gives AI assistants a real edit → run → inspect → fix loop.**

It is designed for trusted Godot 4 workflows: small default tool surface, setup-gated advanced capabilities, and explicit compatibility rules for older/legacy tool names.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Godot 4.x
- Bun 1.3.3+
- MCP-compatible client such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, or OpenCode

### 1) Install GoPeak

```bash
bun add -g https://github.com/HaD0Yun/Doyunha-Gopeak/releases/download/v2.3.9/gopeak-2.3.9.tgz
```

That is the quickest installation path. It installs the bundled runtime directly from GitHub Releases without npm. For a checksum-verified installation, use:

```bash
curl -fLO https://github.com/HaD0Yun/Doyunha-Gopeak/releases/download/v2.3.9/gopeak-2.3.9.tgz
curl -fLO https://github.com/HaD0Yun/Doyunha-Gopeak/releases/download/v2.3.9/gopeak-2.3.9.tgz.sha256
if command -v sha256sum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  sha256sum -c gopeak-2.3.9.tgz.sha256
else
  shasum -a 256 -c gopeak-2.3.9.tgz.sha256
fi
bun add -g "$PWD/gopeak-2.3.9.tgz"
```

The verified path checks the downloaded release before Bun installs it globally. The absolute tarball path avoids a relative-path bug in Bun 1.3.3. The checksum command works on Linux (`sha256sum`) and macOS (`shasum`). To use the supported installer instead, download or clone the repository and run it locally—do not pipe a remote script into a shell:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HaD0Yun/Doyunha-Gopeak.git
cd Doyunha-Gopeak
./install.sh
```

The release archive contains the bundled runtime. Installation and execution do not contact the npm registry or require npm credentials. For stronger provenance checking, release reviewers can also verify the GitHub artifact attestation as described in the [release process](docs/release-process.md).

If you used the old installer, `--dir`, `--godot`, and `--configure` remain accepted with warnings through the `2.3.x` line and are planned for removal in `3.0.0`. The new mappings are: use Bun's global home (`BUN_INSTALL`) instead of a source checkout directory, put `GODOT_PATH` in the MCP client `env`, and use the configuration below instead of relying on installer output. During the compatibility window, `--godot` and `--configure` still print a client snippet but never write client files. See the [migration policy](docs/migration-policy.md#bun-distribution-migration) for the exact contract.

### 2) Add MCP client config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "godot": {
      "command": "gopeak",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "GODOT_PATH": "/path/to/godot",
        "GOPEAK_TOOL_PROFILE": "compact"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`compact` is the default profile. It keeps the initial MCP context small and exposes additional setup-gated groups only when requested.

### 3) Try these prompts

- "List Godot projects in `/your/projects` and show project info."
- "Create `scenes/Player.tscn` with a `CharacterBody2D` root and a movement script."
- "Run the project, read the debug output, and fix the top error."
- "Use `tool.catalog` to find animation tools, then activate the right group."

## What You Get

| Workflow | What GoPeak can do |
|---|---|
| Project control | Find projects, launch the editor, run/stop the game, collect debug output. |
| Scene + script editing | Create scenes, add nodes, edit typed properties, create/modify GDScript. |
| Resource workflows | Work with resources, materials, shaders, imports, and export-related checks. |
| Debugging | Use logs, Godot LSP diagnostics, DAP breakpoints/stack traces, and runtime inspection when configured. |
| Runtime testing | Capture screenshots, inspect live trees, inject input, and call runtime methods through the addon. |
| Tool discovery | Keep the default surface compact, then activate capability groups with `tool.catalog` or `tool.groups`. |

### Setup gates

Some capabilities require extra Godot-side services. GoPeak labels these instead of pretending everything is always available:

| Capability | Requires |
|---|---|
| Editor bridge scene/resource edits | `godot_mcp_editor` plugin enabled in the Godot project. |
| Runtime inspection, screenshots, input injection | Runtime addon/socket, default port `7777`. |
| GDScript LSP tools | Godot LSP enabled on port `6005`. |
| DAP debugging tools | Godot DAP enabled on port `6006`. |
| Asset store/provider tools | Network access and provider availability. |

---

## Add the Godot Plugins

Install from your Godot project folder:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HaD0Yun/Doyunha-Gopeak/main/install-addon.sh | bash
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HaD0Yun/Doyunha-Gopeak/main/install-addon.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex
```

Then enable plugins in **Project Settings → Plugins**:

- `godot_mcp_editor` for bridge-backed scene/resource tools
- `godot_mcp_runtime` for runtime inspection, screenshots, and input workflows

Optional shell hooks for update notifications are opt-in:

```bash
gopeak setup
```

`gopeak setup` only modifies supported bash/zsh rc files when you run it explicitly. Installing the release asset does not add shell hooks automatically.

---

## Tool Profiles

GoPeak supports three exposure profiles:

| Profile | Use when |
|---|---|
| `compact` | Default. Trusted core tools plus dynamic groups activated on demand. |
| `full` | Compatibility/audit mode for the full legacy surface. |
| `legacy` | Older config alias with the same exposed behavior as `full`. |

Set either `GOPEAK_TOOL_PROFILE` or the fallback alias `MCP_TOOL_PROFILE`.

### Dynamic groups

In compact mode, search with `tool.catalog`; matching groups auto-activate. You can also manage groups directly with `tool.groups`.

Common groups:

| Group | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `runtime` | optional-runtime | Live scene tree, properties, method calls, metrics. Requires runtime addon/socket. |
| `testing` | optional-runtime | Screenshots, viewport capture, input injection. Requires runtime/editor setup. |
| `lsp` | optional-lsp | Diagnostics, completion, hover, symbols. Requires Godot LSP on port `6005`. |
| `dap` | optional-dap | Breakpoints, stepping, stack traces. Requires Godot DAP on port `6006`. |
| `asset_store` | optional-network | External CC0 asset search/download. Network/provider dependent. |
| `class_advanced` | trusted-static | ClassDB/inheritance discovery backed by static engine metadata. |
| `tilemap` | audit-required | Must account for Godot 4.3+ `TileMapLayer` behavior before promotion. |
| mutation groups | audit-required | Scene/resource/script/settings/signal/autoload/import/audio/navigation/theme/animation groups need fixture evidence before being marketed as fully trusted. |
| `intent_tracking` | workflow-layer | Workflow memory/handoff helpers, not a Godot engine primitive. Keep opt-in. |

If your MCP client does not refresh after activation, reconnect the client or call the newly activated tool once to force a fresh `tools/list` round-trip.

GoPeak also uses cursor-based pagination for `tools/list` so large profiles are not dumped into context at once. Tune it with `GOPEAK_TOOLS_PAGE_SIZE` when needed.

---

## Typed Godot Values

Bridge-backed scene tools such as `add_node` and `set_node_properties` accept common vector payloads for typed properties:

```json
{
  "position": { "type": "Vector2", "x": 100, "y": 200 },
  "scale": { "type": "Vector2", "x": 2, "y": 2 }
}
```

Plain `{ "x": 100, "y": 200 }` and `[100, 200]` are also coerced for common `Vector2` fields, but tagged values are safest across tools.

---

## Useful Commands

```bash
# run the globally installed CLI
gopeak

# run from source
git clone https://github.com/HaD0Yun/Doyunha-Gopeak.git
cd Doyunha-Gopeak
bun ci
bun run build
bun run ./build/index.js

# local verification
bun run ci
bun run test:dynamic-groups
bun run test:metadata
bun run test:packaging
```

CLI bin names:

- `gopeak`
- `godot-mcp`

## Environment & Ports

| Name | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `GOPEAK_TOOL_PROFILE` | Tool exposure profile: `compact`, `full`, `legacy` | `compact` |
| `MCP_TOOL_PROFILE` | Fallback profile env alias | `compact` |
| `GODOT_PATH` | Explicit Godot executable path | auto-detect |
| `GODOT_BRIDGE_PORT` | Bridge/Visualizer HTTP+WS port override | `6505` |
| `GOPEAK_BRIDGE_HOST` | Bridge/Visualizer bind host | `127.0.0.1` |
| `GOPEAK_TOOLS_PAGE_SIZE` | Number of tools per `tools/list` page | `33` |
| `GOPEAK_RUNTIME_TIMEOUT_MS` | Runtime addon command timeout in milliseconds | `10000` |
| `DEBUG` | Enable server debug logs | `false` |
| `LOG_MODE` | Recording mode: `lite` or `full` | `lite` |

| Port | Service |
|---|---|
| `6505` | Unified Godot Bridge + Visualizer server on loopback by default. |
| `6005` | Godot LSP. |
| `6006` | Godot DAP. |
| `7777` | Runtime addon command socket. |

Runtime screenshot tools (`capture_screenshot`, `capture_viewport`) use a GoPeak-managed temporary PNG file when the runtime addon supports `output_path`, then return normal MCP image content. Older runtime addons that do not receive an `output_path` continue to return inline base64 screenshots.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Godot not found** → set `GODOT_PATH`.
- **No MCP tools visible** → restart your MCP client.
- **Need a hidden tool** → search with `tool.catalog` or activate a group with `tool.groups`.
- **Project path invalid** → confirm `project.godot` exists.
- **Runtime tools not working** → install/enable the runtime addon and check port `7777`.
- **Runtime screenshots time out** → update the runtime addon so screenshot commands support the managed `output_path` flow. For slow runtime responses, raise `GOPEAK_RUNTIME_TIMEOUT_MS`; older addons may still time out on large inline base64 screenshots.
- **Editor bridge disconnected** → stop duplicate `gopeak`/MCP servers that may already own bridge port `6505`; `get_editor_status` reports bridge startup errors such as `EADDRINUSE`.

---

## Migration & Deprecation Policy

GoPeak treats `compact` as the safe default and `full`/`legacy` as compatibility profiles. Future hide, remove, rename, or API-contract changes must include:

1. old → new mapping or an explicit no-replacement note;
2. profile impact (`compact`, `full`, `legacy`, or opt-in group);
3. alias window and planned removal timing;
4. README/docs and release-note updates;
5. verification proving `tools/list` exposure and alias behavior;
6. migration prompt examples for common Godot workflows.

Current stance: legacy tool names and compact aliases remain supported. Optional external groups (`runtime`, `testing`, `lsp`, `dap`, `asset_store`) are setup-gated, not always-available core behavior.

Full policy: [docs/migration-policy.md](docs/migration-policy.md).
